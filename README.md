# Gasadvisor Backend

This is the core backend application for [GasAdvisor](https://www.gasadvisor.it) providing the APIs and logic for the [frontend](https://github.com/DieCi007/gas-frontend) and [Admin console](https://github.com/DieCi007/gas-console).

It is built with `Spring Boot/Kotlin` as a bridge for me to start learning a new language and other things as `liquibase`, creating `shell` scripts and building a clean application overall. I used this opportunity to try and build a self-running application that does not need to be maintained often.
